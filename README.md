### TODO
* Integrate with oauth2

* Track full resource path
    * Will be clear which tenant/namespace/topic we are in
    * Present it nicely
    * It will allow to backtrack
* More commands
    * Delete subscription
* Some kind of dialog modal for confirmation and errors
* Resolve `.unwrap()` calls
* Randomize subscription name to avoid collisions
